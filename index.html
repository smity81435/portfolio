                        <p>Talus Analytics deals almost exclusively with organizations that intend to make change on an international scale. With clients like FEMA, the US CDC, NATO, and Georgetown University, Talus is quickly growing past their peers in the field of datavisualization and statistical analysis. While working for them as a UIUX Design and Web Development Inter over the summer of 2018, they requested that I rebuild the company website. <br><br> The rebuild project, which had initially started as a simple landing page, quickly became increasingly complex, and before long the company decided to incorporate more and more of their content. The tricky part, was creating a page that the company could update dynamically as they they published more of their work. <br><br>To tackle the project, I used a powerful JavaScript library that Talus was using for anumber of their other Data Visualization projects; D3.js. While the D3.js library is normaly used for complex (and stunning) data visualization, I ended up utilizing it to import large datasets full of project descriptions and team information. You can see the result of that implementation in the gif below:</p>

                        <p>
                            I also assisted developers and data scientists at Talus with the development of a web application being design for the United States Department of Homeland Security named MERIT. MERIT is designed to help community planners to make responsible decisions about their comminuty in regards to disaster mitigation: specifically with flooding. The application requested location data, then presented the user with a detailed analysis of that location, and provided them possible solutions to resiliency problems in the area. <br><br> The Application relied heavily on D3.js, and for the first time I was able to witness how the back-end developers could patch in custom API's in order to provide powerful results. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to disclose photos or links to MERIT, or any of the other projects from Talus Analytics &lpar; with the company website being the exception &rpar;.

                        <p>For the past four years, I have been the graphic designer of the Student Veterans Association here at the University of Colorado. I had originally been approached by the President of the SVA to produce t-shirts for the Association, and quickly expanded to making all sorts of products. I have designed, t-shirts, stickers, banners, coozies, flyers, and repeatedly re-designed the logo for them. <br><br> In the fall of 2017, I led a group of five students in the "Student Veterans Association Development Project", where we put together a collection of products for them to place in their new office, and gave a fresh new set of products to take into the upcoming year. We also wrote an extensive report on the SVA, and how we thought that it could better expand by using updated advertisements around campus targeting new student veterans.</p>

                        <p>At some point, I became disenfranchized with going through the campus approval process for all of the new gear that I was producing. They kept telling me that veterans would be targeted on campus if I produced gear for them that other people would see. I completely disagreed, and realized that I needed to take matters into my own hands. Through <a href="http://www.teespring.com" target="_blank">Teespring.com</a>, I made a new line of gear, that donated a portion of all of the profits to the Wounded Warriors Foundation. </p>

                        <p>During a digital design course at the University of Colorado Boulder, I made the UI/UX design and branding for a fictional audiobook app names Pharos. The application, which would utilize artificial intelligence to give you getter book reccomendations, was birthed from my frustrations in finding interesting books to read. The subsequent design practice helped me refine my ability to mold cohesive user experiences. </p>
                        <div class="wow" id="pwow"></div>
                        <p>Pharos was the first time that I went over ten iterations of the same design in a single project. I continued cranking out versions of the landing page long after I had grown tired of it, which now I know is the best way to refine these projects. I shared the design with allof the artists and designers that I knew at the time, and then shared it with some people that had no experience in design whatsoever. It was interesting to see what they agreed on, and where their agreements would end.

                            In the end, I learned that the most simple solution to an issue is usually the best way to go about it, and you really can't count on a user understanding complex interactions without proper onboarding.
                            <br><br>
                            For this assignment, I was asked for the first time to create a full design guide to go with the project. The guide needed to contain all of the design decisions that we made, including the type, color palette, logo design, app design, wireframing and more. Not only did the design guide need to have all of those aspects, but it also needed to be designed in such a way that conveyed the feeling of the application. I thoroughly enjoyed the design guide, as it gave me a feeling that the project and all of the design choices were tangible.
                            <br><br>
                            During the design process of Pharos, utilized a number of applications to achieve the desired result, including: </p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Affinity Designer </li>
                            <li>Adobe Photoshop </li>
                            <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                            <li>Adobe XD</li>
                            <li>InVision App</li>
                            <li>Sketch</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Pharos would later land me my first UI/UX internship at <em>Talus Analytics</em>, where I would spend the summer helping to create web applications for the Department of Homeland Security, and later design the company website. If there ever comes a day when real AI is available on mobile devices, maybe I will revisit this with a team of developers!

                        <p>Sluice was designed as part of the coursework of a UI/UX design course I took during the Spring Semester 2018. While the graphical interface was extremely important to the over design and asthetic of the application, it was also important to have a solid information architecture. For this, we learned and utilized a number of generative techniques, including card sorting and storyboarding. These techniques give us insight to how the user will contemplate the application, and where they will seek the information that is most important to them.<br><br>I had initially thought that the application would have a very different set of features, but after sitting down with some fishermen, raft guides, and kayakers, they informed me that they needed ways to get river data in real time, so that they knew which rivers were running as expected, or what the fish might be doing. For example, in colder waters, the fish will stay towards the bottom of the river, saving their energy, and rarely come up for a strike on a fly. A good fisherman knows that going into rivers that are too cold could be wasting his time, unless he uses modified bait.</p>
                        <div class="wow" id="lwow"></div>
                        <p>Sluice required a lot of tailoring for the professionals it was intended for, and in the process I learned that user interface design is much more about letting the user speak through the app than the designers and developers. To the intended user, the app should be invisible, it should flow &lpar;pun intended&rpar; seamlessly, and provide them only what they need with minimal excess if any at all. Wasting time with extraneous information or steps is an easy way to lose your audience, and lead them to find another solution to their issue.<br><br>My personal favorite part of this whole process was the creation of <em>personas</em>. A persona is a fictional character that the design team makes up to symbolize their inteded user. In this case, Stewart Brown was my intented user. He is a flyfishing guide from Bozeman, MT, who need to know river conditions before he takes his customers halfway across the state in search of trout. We mapped his motivations, goals, frustrations, history, and some of the smaller details about him, including age, marital status and favorite brands. This exhaustive examination of the intended user is what draws out the usefulness of the application. </p>
